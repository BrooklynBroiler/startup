### What I Learned:

#### 1. Steps to using git are as follows:

1. `git pull`
2. make changes you want to make.
3. `git add` . (to add the whole branch, or instead of a . put a file to add)
4. `git status` (lets you see what changes have been made.)
5. `git commit`, click `enter`, type a commit message.
6. `git push`
7. (Optional) use `git log` to see all the commits when you are done.
