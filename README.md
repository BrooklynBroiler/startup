# I Am There!

[My Notes](notes.md)

I am There! is going to be a website that allows people to anonymously coordinate times to play sports, and know for sure that they are going to get to play. There is going to be a way for the place that is facilitating activities to be able to easily update how many people are playing a specified sport. There will be a tab for every sport, for this class there will only be one tab for basketball, but other sports will easily be added to the website where a company sees fit. A person will be able to login, browse what sports are being played, even report anonymously that they will be playing at a specified time, if they would like. If a person is planning on going to play, they may put an estimated time of how long they will be playing. When the employees update the numbers, this will be a seperate report from the self reported section. The patron reported 


## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown - I used proper markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch - I wrote a concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features - I described the key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology - I wrote the description of how I will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references. - I converted my images to png, and then uploaded them to my startup directory, and put them in order in the README.md.

### Elevator Pitch

Are you sick of going to the RB, or any place that you might go to play a sport, and you show up during open play and nobody else is there? Or maybe you even get there right before everyone was planning on leaving!! I am going to end this problem THIS semester with a website called "I Am There!" With "I Am There" I will help a person see the amount of people who are playing the sport they would like to play, and how long those people are planning on staying to play. It will involve the facilatating party, and those participating in the sport to help keep an acurate description of how many people are playing each sport. This will not only be benificial to the people wanting to play, but will help with the facilitators to analyze what sports are most popular, and how many people are showing up to play. There will be no more time wasted, as well as no more crushed expectations. People will be more willing to go play sports, and they to will be able to confidently say "I Am There!".
